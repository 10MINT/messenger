This is the only authorized place to download the sources of the TextMe project. 
My aim is to create an instant messenger with Thunkable.
It has been splitted into 3 sub-projects

* TextMe, an instant messenger with account system
   * Visit the related 
   [Thunkable topic](https://community.thunkable.com/t/preview-textme-another-thunkable-instant-messenger/10465) for updates
* SecureChat, the Proof of Concept for encrypted chats
   * Visit the related [Thunkable topic](https://community.thunkable.com/t/secure-chat-proof-of-concept/18016) 
   for updates
* TextSecure, an instant messenger with end-to-end encryption

All projects use Firebase to send text over wifi and HTML to render the chat. The projects have been created with Thunkable 
for Android and they rely on their components. However, SecureChat was designed to work in App Inventor as well
