# textme-sources

This is the only authorized place to download the sources of the TextMe project. 
My aim is to create an instant messenger with Thunkable.
It has been splitted into 3 sub-projects

   * Visit the related [Thunkable topic](https://community.thunkable.com/t/textsecure-a-secure-instant-messenger-made-with-thunkable/27718) for updates & discussion

All projects use Firebase to store the messages and HTML to render the chat. The projects have been created with Thunkable 
for Android and they rely on their FAB component. However, SecureChat was designed to work in App Inventor as well

This is an open-source project, [help](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [donations](//paypal.me/lennartwenke) are always welcome.
