# My Messenger Project

The goal of this project is to create an instant messenger with no coding required. I use the App Inventor platform and one of its derivatives (Thunkable Classic) to achieve this goal.
The project has been splitted up into several sub-projects

All projects use Firebase to store the messages and HTML to render the chat. The projects have been created with Thunkable 
for Android and they rely on their FAB component. However, SecureChat was designed to work in App Inventor as well
