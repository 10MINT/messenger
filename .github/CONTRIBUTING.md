This is an open-source project, you are welcome to collaborate!
You can help by providing example .aia's or developing extensions.
I currently need help with the following things:
* Backup the app's TinyDB tags and values
* Backup the app's data folder
* Create polls, vote and view them in the app
* Make group chats in firebase
* Smart image caching
* Only allow square images to pick with the ActivityStarter
* Can we select files with the ActivityStarter?

If you have worked with the sources before:
* Solve the problem that background image does not adapt to the button's shape
* Solve the WebViewer's problem with fullscreen videos
* Find out if it's possible to make the Firebase.DataChanged block run in the background
