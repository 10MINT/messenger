# SecureChat
Visit [Thunkable](https://community.thunkable.com/t/secure-chat-proof-of-concept/18016) for more information.
This project has been expicitly designed to run in App Inventor, resulting in a lower minSDK level for Android

## How To
* One user clicks "Generate code"
* The other clicks "SCAN" and scans the other's barcode

You can later start a new chat by clicking the user's name. And because this is a proof of concept, only one chat 
at a time is possible. You can add images and links by copying the url into the text box.
